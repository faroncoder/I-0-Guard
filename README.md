# I/0  Guard

A command management and process monitoring solution for preventing bottlenecks and ensuring efficient operation in a development environment. I/0  Guard uses `preexec` hooks, custom scripts, and centralized logging to manage all terminal commands, optimizing resource usage and maintaining system stability.

## Overview

I/0  Guard is designed to:
- Monitor and manage all commands executed in your terminal.
- Prevent duplicate processes and reduce system bottlenecks.
- Centralize logging and command handling for consistency and maintainability.
- Enhance the performance of environments running resource-intensive applications, such as Django projects.

## Key Features

- **Centralized Command Management**: Automatically traps all terminal commands and reroute commands and executions them via a centralized script.
- **Process Monitoring**: Monitors background tasks and prevents redundant or conflicting executions.
- **Efficient Resource Usage**: Optimizes CPU, memory, and other resources to avoid bottlenecks and ensure smooth operation.
- **Extensible and Customizable**: Easily adapt the scripts to fit your specific environment or project requirements.  Three scripts will be executed on the fly, and the work will begin immediately.

## USE CASE

As I have experienced, developers working with the Django framework often encounter bottlenecked environments that cause project completion delays. This project aims to balance resource usage, creating a controlled environment that optimizes resource allocation and allows developers to work efficiently without encountering bottlenecks.

## Executing  these scripts is straightforward.   
1. Git clones the scripts into your home directory, which will reside inside your account desktop's root directory (for example, on Ubuntu). These scripts should still reside in my directory `/home/faron/.local/lib/io_gateway.`
2. I wouldn't not recommend this to be run systemwide but it effectively perform well on user
