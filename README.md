# I/0  Guard

A command management and process monitoring solution for preventing bottlenecks and ensuring efficient operation in a development environment. I/0  Guard uses `preexec` hooks, custom scripts, and centralized logging to manage all terminal commands, optimizing resource usage and maintaining system stability.

## Overview

I/0  Guard is designed to:
- Monitor and manage all commands executed in your terminal.
- Prevent duplicate processes and reduce system bottlenecks.
- Centralize logging and command handling for consistency and maintainability.
- Enhance the performance of environments running resource-intensive applications, such as Django projects.

## Key Features

- **Centralized Command Management**: Automatically traps all terminal commands and rereoute commands executions them via a centralized script.
- **Process Monitoring**: Monitors background tasks and prevents redundant or conflicting executions.
- **Efficient Resource Usage**: Optimizes CPU, memory, and other resources to avoid bottlenecks and ensure smooth operation.
- **Extensible and Customizable**: Easily adapt the scripts to fit your specific environment or project requirements.  Three scripts will be executed on the fly, and the work will begin immediately.

## USE CASE

USE CASE
Developers working with the Django framework often encounter bottlenecked environments that cause delays in project completion, as I have experienced myself. This project aims to balance resource usage, creating a controlled environment that optimizes resource allocation and allows developers to work efficiently without encountering bottlenecks.
